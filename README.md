# REMI BOT
REMI BOT is an experimental project utilizing Anthropic's Claude 3 OPUS model to visualize and manipulate a data. After a CSV file is provided, the data is inserted into a MySQL DB and can be manipulated using SQL queries generated from natural language prompts. Visualization code can also be generated via natural language prompt utilizing the Vega-Altair python library. Finally, users can prompt Claude with research related questions, leveraging Claude's incredible problem solving abilities.
